You could do as Tom suggests, but there's at least one easy way to do it without changing Person.FavoriteColor to a string.

Add a property to Person called FavoriteColorString:

public class Person 
{
    [...]
    public colorEnum FavoriteColor { get; set; }
    public string FavoriteColorString
    {
        get { return FavoriteColor.ToString(); }
        set { FavoriteColor = (colorEnum)Enum.Parse(typeof(colorEnum), value);  }
    }
}
Recompile so the new property shows up in the bindingsource.

Now bind comboBoxFavoriteColor.SelectedItem to FavoriteColorString.

And at runtime, do as Tom said:

comboBoxFavoriteColor.DataSource = Enum.GetNames(typeof(colorEnum));
Voila! It should now work the way you want.

When you persist the settings objects, just don't persist the FavoriteColorString property.
